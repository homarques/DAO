Dimensionality-Aware Outlier Detection
Submitted to ICDM 2023
```

In this paper, we present a nonparametric method for outlier detection that takes full account of local variations in intrinsic dimensionality within the dataset. Using the theory of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID), our 'dimensionality-aware' outlier detection method, DAO, is derived as an estimator of an asymptotic local expected density ratio involving the query point and a close neighbor drawn at random. The dimensionality-aware behavior of DAO is due to its use of local estimation of LID values in a theoretically-justified way.

Through comprehensive experimentation on more than 800 synthetic and real datasets, we show that DAO significantly outperforms three popular and important benchmark outlier detection methods: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Simplified LOF, and kNN.

Fig. 1. ROC AUC values for outlier detection performance over 480 synthetic datasets containing 2 clusters. One of the clusters (c<sub>1</sub>) has intrinsic dimension fixed at 8. The intrinsic dimension of the other cluster (c<sub>2</sub>) varies across the datasets (x-axis). The dashed vertical line indicates the reference set where both clusters lie on manifolds with the same intrinsic dimension (8). The results shown are averages over 30 datasets with the same characteristics. Bars indicate standard deviation.

Fig. 2. Differences in ROC AUC performance between DAO<sub>MLE</sub> and the dimensionality-unaware methods over 393 real datasets. Blue dots indicate datasets where DAO outperforms its competitor, whereas red dots indicate the opposite. The 'Oracle' method indicates the best-performing competitor for each individual dataset. Color intensity is proportional to the ROC AUC difference. On the x- and y-axis we show the Moran's I autocorrelation and dispersion R of log-LID estimates, respectively.
